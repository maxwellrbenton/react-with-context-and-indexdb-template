# React with Context and IndexDB

This is a basic template of a functioning React app that uses both the
Context API and the web browsers IndexDB to persist data. With IndexDB,
application state is stored in the browser on update. On load, if there
is any existing data, state is updated to include it. This allows for
serverless data persistence.
